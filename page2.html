        <div class="page-2p">I thought about what is the <mark>difference</mark> between <mark>film making</mark>and <mark>designingy</mark>, then I realized that there isnâ€™t much of a difference between the two. Designers may not be storytellers but they have to <a class="id">identify</a>and curate ways to capture and assist the viewers to understand a story or a design. Designers are often challenged with creating a narrative with type and luring in people to <a class="read">read it.</a>They also have to know <mark>typography </mark>in order to understand how they can utilize the type. Some of the major elements that designers use are <a class="line">line</a>, form, <a class="color">color</a>, contrast, <span class="scale">scale</span>, and weight. Those are only a fraction of the elements that we have to learn and use when designing.</div>
