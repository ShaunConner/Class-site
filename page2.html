        <div class="page-2p">I thought about what is the <a class="difference">difference</a>between <a class="film">film making</a> and <a class="design">designing</a>, then I realized that there isnâ€™t much of a difference between the two. Designers may not be storytellers but they have to identify and curate ways to capture and assist the viewers to understand a story or a design. Designers are often challenged with creating a narrative with type and luring in people to read it. They also have to know typography in order to understand how they can utilize the type. Some of the major elements that designers use are line, form, <a class="color">color</a>, contrast, scale, and weight. Those are only a fraction of the elements that we have to learn and use when designing.</div>
